What the hell did you do to me
WHat's this spell that you've put on me
I don turn side character for my own story
I don try to dey balance am but i no fit
And you no gree

Cos i been no wan fall before
Its funny how we cam all the way from that friendship thing
Then we fell in love

Its really amazing whenever you say you're scared to do too much
When i can't get enough, oh girl I'm gone
Girl i'm lost in my thoughts of you
